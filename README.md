  Download Dataset
  Data Preparation and Cleaning
  Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
    (i) Which Crop has the highest yield in India?
    (ii) Sstate wise distribution of Yield of each crop: For each crop, which state has maximum yield?
    (iii) In each state, which crops has minimum cultivation cost, production cost and has maximum yield?
   Data Cleaning
     (iv) 4. How does land area, production and yield used for cultivation of each crop vary from 2006-2011?
     (v) For every year, which crop has max/min area, production, yield?
